# Week 2 – Personal Bio Page

This project is a simple personal bio page built using HTML.

It contains:
- Headings
- Paragraphs
- Lists

The most useful tags I learned were:
- <h1> and <h2> for headings
- <p> for paragraphs
- <ul> and <li> for lists

This project helped me understand HTML structure better.
